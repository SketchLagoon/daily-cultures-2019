To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

<h4>The way we use information.</h4>
<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalogue as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.</p>
<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<h4>Our commitment to data security.</h4>
<p>To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<h4>Our commitment to children's privacy.<h4>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 16, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 16.</p>
<h4>Cookies.</h4>
<p>We may use “cookies” for administrative purposes such as cataloguing traffic patterns throughout the site and can use a “cookie” to assign a “User ID” for this purpose. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. If you have a user ID this will automatically identify your computer –but not you – to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know who you are, even if we do assign a cookie to your computer.</p>
<p>Other companies that advertise on our site may also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that we do not control. However, since cookies aren’t use able for identifying individuals, these advertisers will never know who you are – and we will not reveal that information to them.</p>
